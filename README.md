# SteamUploader
A Script for uploading your Unity Game To a Steam Depot

Steps: 
0: please dont rename any of the folders or files in this directory
1: download latest steam sdk from https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/list


FOR THE FIRST RUN ONLY (Required to cache the builder files) 
3: Go to ```<sdk_version>/sdk/tools/SteamPipeGUI.zip``` and extract the zip file
4: run ```<sdk_version>/sdk/tools/SteamPipeGUI/SteamPipeGUI.exe```
    There are tutorials online how to do this, pretty self explanatory though I believe in you
5: once you complete one build with the GUI, you can close it and drag the ContentBuilder folder /YourUnityProject/ 
Should be good to build
